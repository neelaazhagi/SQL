Grow your knowledge of SQL and gain a new perspective of how to maximize SQL—and learn how to go beyond creating databases and pulling data from tables. This course provides a real-world application SQL programmers can utilize to enhance learning—and a project you can add to your coding portfolios. Instructor Megan Silvey presents a project that focuses on performing an analysis on retail data by utilizing SQL. Analyze data that includes tables with product, sales, and customer information for an ecommerce retailer. Learn about updating information in the tables, analyzing sales data, evaluating customer data, and more.

The objective of this course is to provide a life-like application for SQL programmers that they can use to enhance their learning along with providing them with a potential project to add to their portfolio. This project will focus on performing an analysis on retail data by utilizing SQL. The data will include tables with product, sales, and customer information for an e-commerce retailer such as Binaryville robots or H+ Sport from the LinkedIn Learning asset bank. The analysis will include updating information in the tables, analyzing sales data, evaluating customer data, and more.

## File Structure
There is one branch for this course containing three chapter folders corresponding to the three chapters in the course. Inside these chapter folders are the coding exercise files. The naming convention for the exercise files is CHAPTER#_MOVIE#. As an example, the branch named 02_03 corresponds to the second chapter and the third video in that chapter.

All coding exercise files will have a beginning and an end state, for example '02_03e' would be the ending file for the third movie in the second chapter. These are marked with the letters b for "beginning" and e for "end". The b file contains the code as it is at the beginning of the movie. The e file contains the code as it is at the end of the movie.
